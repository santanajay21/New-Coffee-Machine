# New-Coffee-Machine

This is another variation of the coffee machine program that I created earlier. The difference between the two is that this coffee machine program is now using objects. Objects makes it much easier to create project without having to use so many likes of code. When building larger projects OOP is used because procedural coding is not optional.
